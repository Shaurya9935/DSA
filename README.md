# DSA Progress 📘

Hi, I'm **Shaurya Gupta**, and I'm practicing Data Structures and Algorithms using the **Striver DSA Sheet**.

This repository contains solutions to problems that I’ve solved **completely on my own** — no copying, no shortcuts. Every solution reflects my own understanding and thought process.

## 🧠 Why I Started This

Until now, I used to solve problems directly on LeetCode without saving them.  
But from now on, I’ll **push my solutions daily** so I can:
- Track my personal progress 📈
- Revisit past problems when needed 🧾
- Share my journey with others 🚀

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

- All problems are organized by **date** or **problem name**.
- Solutions are written in **C++** (unless mentioned otherwise).
- Each file represents one problem I’ve solved.

---

## 📅 Goal

To stay consistent and push **at least one DSA problem daily**.

If you're on the same journey, feel free to follow along or use these solutions for reference (but always try first yourself 😉).

Let’s grow together. 💪
